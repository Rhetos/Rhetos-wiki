## Data model and relationships

[Data model](Data-model-and-relationships):

* **Module** `<name>` - Generates a C# namespace and a database schema.
* **DataStructure** `<Module>.<name>` - Basic concept for any data structure (e.g. Entity, Browse, Computed, ...) which may contain properties. It is usually not directly used in DSL script.
* **Entity** `<Module>.<name>` - Represents data entered by user or generated by the system. Creates a C# class and database table. Inherits the DataStructure concept.

Simple [property](Data-structure-properties) types:

* **ShortString** `<DataStructure> <field name>` - Maximal length 256 characters.
* **LongString** `<DataStructure> <field name>` - Unlimited length.
* **Integer** `<DataStructure> <field name>`
* **Decimal** `<DataStructure> <field name>`
* **Money** `<DataStructure> <field name>`
* **Bool** `<DataStructure> <field name>`
* **Date** `<DataStructure> <field name>`
* **DateTime** `<DataStructure> <field name>`
* **Guid** `<DataStructure> <field name>`
* **Binary** `<DataStructure> <field name>`

[Relationships](Data-model-and-relationships) and [navigation](Data-structure-properties) properties:

* **Reference** `<DataStructure>.<field name> <referenced data structure>` - Lookup field. Used as type of referenced class in the object model. Represents database FK, having "ID" suffix appended at the column name.
* **Reference** `<DataStructure>.<field name>` - Simplified syntax in case when the field name is same as the name of the referenced entity.
* **Detail** `<Reference>` - Marks entity as detail of the referenced entity and sets CascadeDelete and SqlIndex.
* **Extends** `<Extension DataStructure>.<base DataStructure>` - Marks first data structure as extension of base data structure. Usually used to extend entity with additional computed data or to extend legacy entities with the data entered by user. Concept means that extension has the same primary key (ID) value as base records. Extension has to return one record by every base data record.
* **LinkedItems**
* **CascadeDelete** `<Reference>` - During the delete process, all related entities will be deleted.

Other concepts:

* [**Browse**](Read-only-data-structures) `<Module>.<name> <original data structure>` - Data structure used to read certain data fields from original data structure. Old name is "SnowFlake".
  * **Take** `<Browse> <field name or references path>` - Creates property on the browse data structure using field name of the original data structure. Beside field naming it can be set by reference path, separated by dot too.
    * Path must be within the quotation marks.
    * If the paths is set, field name will be automatically generated connecting the field from the path (e.g. Take 'Parent.Class.Name'; => ShortString ParentClassName).
    * Beside reference, as path is it possible to use Base (navigation from extension to base class), `Extends_<Extension name>` (navigation from base to extension) and ID (as Guid property).
    * Browse structure can have Reference field (Take Parent, e.g.), which gets Guid ID from the referenced structure (ParentID) and navigation property (Parent). It recommended to use just Guid field (e.g. Take 'Parent.ID';) instead.
  * **Take** `<Browse> <field name> '<reference path>'` - Explicitly sets name of created field at the browse structure.
  * **From** `<Browse Property> <field name or reference path>` - Possible to use referenced data, extended data or base structure data.
    * It is recommended to use Take concept instead From because of simplicity.
* **LegacyEntity** `<Module>.<name> <table> <view>` - Data structure which reads data from the view, used to integrate old entities from existing systems inside Rhetos. Table is used so other Rhetos entities could reference LegacyEntity. Table has to have uniqueidentifier ID field with default `NEWID()` and unique index. LegacyEntity is writeable from Rhetos. If the view is not updateable, it is possible to add instead-of triggers for storing using SqlTrigger.
  * **LegacyEntity** `<Module>.<name> <table>` - Creates view with entity name and according instead-of triggers for data recording.
  * **LegacyProperty**
  * **LegacyPropertyReadOnly**
* **Implements** `<DataStructure>.<interface type>` - Implementing given interface on the object model data structure.
* **PropertyFrom** `<destination DataStructure> <source Property>` - Copies field from another data structure. Transferring related Required and SqlIndex concepts.
* **AllPropertiesFrom** `<destination DataStructure> <source DataStructure>` - Copies all fields from another data structure as PropertyFrom. Transferring related Extends concept.
* **AllPropertiesWithCascadeDeleteFrom** `<destination DataStructure> <source DataStructure>` - Copies all fields from another data structure as AllPropertiesFrom. Transfers related CascadeDelete concepts (e.g. Detail).
* [**Polymorphic**](Polymorphic-concept) - Defining common interface which implements more entities.

## Simple business rules

See full article: [Implementing simple business rules](Implementing-simple-business-rules).

Property value constraints:

* **Required** `<Property>` - Required field that must be filled by user.
  * **SystemRequired** `<Property>` - System field which must be filled by system internally.
  * **UserRequired** `<Property>` - User (or client applications) needs to provide the property value.
* **Unique** - `<Property>` - Two records cannot have same value inside this field.
  * **Unique** `<DataStructure> <Property1> <Property2>`
  * **Unique** `<DataStructure> <Property1> <Property2> <Property3>`
  * **UniqueMultiple** `<DataStructure> <field names separated by comma>` - One string contains n fields.
* **MinValue** `<Property>` - Limit the smallest allowed value of the property.
* **MaxValue** `<Property>` - Limit the largest allowed value of the property.
* **MinLength** `<Property>` - Limited string length in ShortString or LongString field. Limits lower range.
* **MaxLength** `<Property>` - Limited string length in ShortString or LongString field. Limits higher range.
* **Range** `<PropertyFrom> <PropertyTo>` - Value of the first field has to be less or equal to the second field (fields have to be of the same type).
  * **DateRange** `<PropertyFrom> <PropertyTo>` - Derivation of Range which creates Date Field in case they are not existent.
  * **DateTimeRange** `<PropertyFrom> <PropertyTo>` - Derivation of Range which creates DateTime fields in case they are not existent.
  * **IntegerRange** `<PropertyFrom> <PropertyTo>` - Derivation of range which creates Integer fields in case they are not existent.
* **RegExMatch** `<Property>` - Text must match given regex expression.

Deny data modifications:

* **InvalidData** `<DataStructure>.<filter name> <message> <Property>` - Restricts data recording for the given property by included filter (filter has to return incorrect data).
* **Lock** `<DataStructure>.<filter name> <message> <property>` - Restricts editing or deleting data for the given property by included filter (filter should return locked records).
* **DenyUserEdit** `<Entity>` - Entity with hardcoded data. It is not allowed to make changes using web interface (REST/SOAP).
* **DenyUserEdit** `<Property>` - Not allowed to edit field values using web interface (REST/SOAP). Remark: It is considered not good practice to combine fields at the same entity, which user can and cannot edit. It is recommended to separate those computed fields on the entity extension.

Automatically generated data:

* **AutoCode** `<ShortString property>` - Generates integer codes with the given prefix. This concept includes Unique and Index.
  * **AutoCodeForEach** `<ShortString property> <grouping property>` - Generates integer codes with the given prefix, using independent count for each group.
* **CreationTime** `<DateTime property>` - Stores records creation time.
* **ModificationTimeOf** `<DateTime property> <Modified property>` - Stores time of the update for the given field at the same entity.

Logging data changes and auditing:

* **Logging** `<entity>` - Includes logging all entity changes. It is required to set the properties from which changes should be tracked.
  * **Log** `<Logging <Property>` - Sets properties which changes are tracked.
  * **AllProperties** `<Logging>` - Enables logging on all properties.

Other features:

* **Deactivatable** `<Entity>` - Allows tracking of active and deactivated records. Generated property `Bool Active`.
* **PessimisticLocking** `<Entity>` - Enables automatic verification of explicit client locks when saving a record. Generated server actions SetLock and ReleaseLock.

## Computed data and read-only data structures

[Read-only data structures](Read-only-data-structures):

* **Computed** `<Module>.<name> <repository => C# script ... Result[]>`
* **SqlQueryable** `<Module>.<name> <SQL script>` - Queryable computation, defined inside SQL script. Creates new database view by the given script. This concept should be used with SqlDependsOn concept, so the database objects could be created at required order.

Additional concepts:

* **QueryableExtension** `<Module>.<name> <source DataStructure> <(IQueryable<source> source, repository) => ... IQueryable<Result>>` - Extension concept which defines easier computations like aggregate data on the header of the document, financial consequence of document item and similar. Types which are returned by expression should have ID field (`=sourceItem.ID`) and Base (`=sourceItem`).
* **ExternalReference** `<Module>.<type or assembly>` - Adds required dll reference for compilation of the object model. Dll can be set on two ways:
  * (Recommended) By C# type which is used (set assembly qualified name). Assembly Qualified Name should not contain Version, Culture or PublicKeyToken if it is custom dll. It should contain only if it is .NET framework type.
  * By dll name (e.g. 'rhetos.MyFunctions.dll').
* **UseExecutionContext** `<computation>` - Enables ExecutionContext parameter for computations.
  This is obsolete because the ExecutionContext is available in filter and actions as member `_executionContext`.

[Saving computed data](Persisting-the-computed-data):

* **Persisted** `<Module.<name> <source DataStructure>` - Creates database table which will contain data from the source. Source can be some of the computations or any other data structure (e.g. Browse).
* **AllProperties** `<Persisted>` - Enables persistence of all computed properties. Additionally transfers indexes and cascade delete defines and Extends concept.
* **KeepSynchronized** `<Persisted>`
* **KeepSynchronized** `<Persisted> safe filter: (IE<DS> items, repository) => IE<DS> Items'` - Saves updates only for the records which are filtered.
* **ComputeForNewBaseItems**

Defining interdependent computations so the **KeepSynchronized** can know when to update cached data:

* **ChangesOnBaseItem** `<computation>` If the computation is extension of some entity, then some computed records depend on the related base entity
* **ChangesOnLinkedItems** `<computation <reference property>` - If computation is extension of some entity, then some computed records depend on entities which are referenced by base document.
  * E.g. if you are computing additional data about the document and that data depends on some document item (e.g. item number or total amount) then it is required to reference the property of that item. That will result in recomputing some items on the related document which is referenced by the item.
* **ChangesOnReferenced**
* **ChangesOnChangedItems** `<computation> <entity> <filter name> <entity[] changedItems => .. filter parameters>` - Programmable concept for defining related computed items. Filter has to be implemented in the data structure of the computation and persisted data structure which will contain saved computation. FilterAll and System.Guid[] are commonly used filters supported by all entities.
  * E.g. if some change of entity needs to be recomputed, it can be used this way: `ChangesOnChangedItems Test.Item 'FilterAll' changedItems => new FilterAll()';`
  * E.g. ChangesOnLinkedItems should be implemented by ChangesOnChangedItems this way: `ChangesOnChangedItems Test.Item 'System.Guid[]' 'changedItems => changedItems.Where(item => item.HeaderID.HasValue).Select(item => item.HeaderID.Value).Distinct().ToArray()';`
* **KeyProperties**

## Filters

See full article: [Developing filters and other read methods](Filters-and-other-read-methods).

* **FilterBy** `<DataStructure>.'<Parameter>''(repository, parameter) => ... filtered DataStructure[]'`
* **ComposableFilterBy** `<DataStructure>.'<Parameter>''(IQ<DataStructure> items, repository, parameter) => ... filtered IQ<DS>items'`

Additional concepts:

* **ItemFilter** `<DataStructure>.'<FilterName>''item => ... bool'` - helper concept for simplified definition of simple filters (Creates ComposableFilterBy).
* **Parameter** - Data structure used as filter parameter. Usually represents filter name too. Although any data structure can be used as filter parameter, this helper concept is useful for more descriptive DSL writing.
* **UseExecutionContext** `<FilterBy>` - Enables IExecutionContext as additional filter parameter.
* **FilterByReferenced** `<DetailDataStructure>.'<Parameter>'<Parent reference>'IE<Detail> => .. additional filter or sort from group with the same parent'` - Creates filter on the detail structure which returns data related to the filter on the parent structure. Assuming parent structure already has that filter defined.
* **FilterByLinkedItems** `<ParentDataStructure>.'<Parameter>'<detail reference>'` - Creates filter on the parent structure which returns data related to the filter on the detail structure. Assuming detail structure already has defined filter.

Beside these explicitly defined filters, generic filters are available trough REST service and SOAP web interfaces on all concept which are queryable. (Entity, Browse, SqlQueryable, QueryableExtension, ...)

## Reports

* [**TemplaterReport**](TemplaterReport) `<Module>.<name>'file path'` - Spire template report.
  * Enables generating and downloading of report trough SOAP interface (DownloadReportCommand).
  * **REMARK:** This concept is not implemented inside CommonConcepts package. It is required to include "TemplaterReport" DSL package.
  * Report is also a data structure. Properties on the report represent report parameters.
  * File path should be formed like: 'package name\file name', because file could end up in subfolder.
  * Supported file types are doc, docx, xls and xlsx.
  * Supports download in original and pdf format.
* **Data Sources** `<Report>.'comma separated data structures'` - Provide data sources in ordered list. It is not required to provide module name.
  * Each provided data source should have filter implementation with parameter named same as the report.
  * It is recommended to use FilterByBase, FilterByReferenced and FilterByLinkedItems how to avoid redundant writing of similar filter on related structures (e.g. documents and related items which are shown on the report).
* **DataSource** `<Report>.'order' <DataStructure>` - Not required to use, it is simpler through DataSources macro concept .
* **ConvertFormat** `<Report>.'format'` - Subset of functionalities from TemplaterReport: only data download without file generating. On the object model repository, only GetReportData function is generated. This concept can be used with DataSources.
* **ReportFile** `<Module>.<name> '(object[][] reportData, string convertFormat, executionContext) => .. code for generating Rhetos.Dom.DefaultConcepts.ReportFile {string Name, byte[] Content}'` - Similar like TemplaterReport, only instead of Spire template, custom file generating code is used from downloaded data. This concept is implemented in CommonConcepts package.

## Complex concepts

Hierarchy:

* **Hierarchy** `<DataStructure>.<Name>` - Generates recursive reference to itself. Sets name of Reference property. Additionally generates and maintains persistent data to quickly handle given hierarchy.
  * Computed data containing fields: Level (depth of each element in the tree), LeftIndex and RightIndex (for quick tree search).
  * Computed data can be used from the entity as extension (e.g. item.Extension: `<EntityName><HierarchyName>`Hierarchy.Level).
  * On the given entity, ComposableFilter "`<HierarchyName>`HierarchyDescendants" with ID (Guid) parameter is generated, which can be used for quick access of all direct and indirect child records. Also filter "`<HierarchyName>`HierarchyAncestors" is being generated, for accessing all direct and indirect parents.
* **Hierarchy** `<DataStructure>.<Name> <PathName> <PathProperty> <PathSeparator>` - With standard Hierarchy functionality, this concepts additionally computes path for data record.
  * Path is generated with values from PathProperty. PathProperty can be name of the property or path to some referenced data (like Browse).
  * Path is saved within existing extension (Extension_`<EntityName><HierarchyName>`Hierarchy, inside property with the given name `<PathName>`.
* **SingleRoot** `<Hierarchy>` - Limits insert to only one root record.

[History](Temporal-data-and-change-history):

* **History** `<Entity>` - Includes logging of old entity version inside new entity with suffix "_History".
* **AllProperties** `<History>` - Includes logging of old versions for all properties.
* **History** `<Property>` - Includes logging of old versions for selected property. If History concept is added to the property, it doesn't have to be added on the entity itself. This concept can be added to more properties.
  
## Server actions

See full article: [Action concept](Action-concept).

* **Action** `<Module>.<name> <parameter, repository, userInfo) => {...C# script }>` - Server action which runs C# script. Can be started trough REST and SOAP interfaces. It can have parameters: Action which is DataStructure, so it can have properties added to it, which are used as C# script parameters.
* **UseExecutionContext**  `<Action>` - Enables using of additional IExecutionContext argument: (parameter, repository, userInfo, executionContext) => ...

## Claims and permissions

* **CustomClaim** `'<custom resource name>''<custom action or claim right>'` - Additional claim which can be given to the selected users and domain groups through standard permissions interface, checked by IAuthorizationManager. Should be defined outside Module structure. E.g. `CustomClaim 'ProjectName.HomePage' 'AllMenuItemsVisible';`
* [**RowPermissions**](RowPermissions-concept) - Restricts access for selected users by defined subset data of some entity.

See more on [User authentication and authorization](User-authentication-and-authorization).

## Database objects

See full article: [Low-level database development](Database-objects).

This concepts are used only as workaround, for features that are not directly supported in Rhetos:

* **SqlProcedure** `<Module>.<Name> <ProcedureArguments> <ProcedureSource>`
* **SqlTrigger** `<DataStructure>.<Name> <Events> <TriggerSource>`
* **SqlFunction** `<Module>.<Name> <Arguments> <RETURNS ... AS ... function source>`
* **SqlView** `<Module>.<Name> <ViewSource>`
* **SqlIndex**
* **SqlIndexMultiple**
* **Clustered** Creates clustered SqlIndex and SqlIndexMultiple.
* **SqlDefault** - Sets default constraint to the related database column. This concept is used only for internal functionality implemented in SQL procedures and triggers. This concept cannot be used as default field value within data recording through Rhetos server, because server always records NULL value for empty field value.
* [**SqlObject**](SqlObject-concept) `<Module>.<Name> <CreateSQL> <RemoveSQL>` - Way of generating other unsupported objects, e.g. full-text search.

Dependencies between the database objects are important for the ordering
in which the object will be created in the database.
Use the following concepts to define the dependencies:

* **SqlDependsOn** - Defines concept interdependence so the objects can be created by required order during deployment. Target can be module, entity or property.
* **SqlDependsOnView**
* **SqlDependsOnFunction**
* **SqlDependsOnSqlObject**
* **PrerequisiteAllProperties**
* **AutodetectSqlDependencies** `<Module>` - Detects and generated dependencies (SqlDependsOn) for SqlQueryable, SqlView, SqlFunction, SqlProcedure, SqlTrigger and LegacyEntity view. It may be applied to any of those objects or to a whole module.
* **AutodetectSqlDependencies** `<DatabaseObject>`
