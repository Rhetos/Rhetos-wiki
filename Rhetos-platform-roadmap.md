This roadmap presents high-level priorities, goals and plans for further development of the platform.
Each point represents a themed group which will be broken into one or more projects during implementation.

The best way to give feedback is to create issues or comment and vote on existing [issues](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos/issues).

## 1. Runtime performance

There are many possibilities to improve the runtime performance at the framework level,
that could provide benefits to both new and existing Rhetos apps:
data caching, read scalability, batching database writes and queries (validations),
reducing row permissions to aggregate roots, and other.

## 2. Extending developer's toolset

There is an active list of project [Candidates](https://github.com/Rhetos/Rhetos/milestone/11)
on GitHub issues list.
It contains features such as

- DSL concepts for simpler business process implementation (BPM) with high performance,
- asynchronous and background processing,
- Swagger/OpenAPI integration,
- better support for multitenant applications,
- and others.
